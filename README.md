# market-data-service

I architected, coded, and shipped a production-ready market-data microservice that ingests live quotes, streams them through Kafka, and exposes them via clean REST endpoints. Using FastAPI with dependency-injected service layers, I implemented GET /prices/latest and POST /prices/poll, backed by PostgreSQL models for raw responses, processed price points, moving averages, and polling jobs. A pluggable provider interface (initially Alpha Vantage) fetches data at rated-limited intervals; each quote is published to a price-events topic with confluent-kafka-python, then a consumer computes five-point moving averages and upserts results—all fully containerised in Docker-Compose (API, Postgres, Kafka/ZooKeeper, Adminer). CI/CD is handled by GitHub Actions—lint, tests, image build—while OpenAPI docs, a Postman collection, and a diagram-rich README give instant developer onboarding. The result is a secure, observable service (graceful shutdown, structured logging, Prometheus hooks) that can be stood up with one command and queried for real-time prices within seconds.
